# Landing Page Project

This project requires you to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

> This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM.

## Quickstart/Demo

you can find live demo [Here]() done by [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/)

If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a [ZIP](https://github.com/mlotfic/fornt-end-nd-project-02-landing-page/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of all the files directly, or run the following [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) command to clone the files to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlotfic/fornt-end-nd-project-02-landing-page.git
```

- Once the files are on your machine, open the `fornt-end-nd-project-02-landing-page` folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the **Go Live** button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
